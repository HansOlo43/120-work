## [hw-5 Animation](https://hansolo43.github.io/120-work/hw-5/)
This week in coding, we learned how to do basic animations with javascript. At first, it was a little confusing how to do all of this stuff, but once I started loosely following the example, it all started to make sense. The new skill of being able to make your own variables will come in handy in the future for sure. This week I helped my study group for this class by working through all of the problems we faced as they came up. Having a group for this class is a great resource, as it allows you to put your heads together to work through problems.
