This week, we learned about for loops and while loops. These allow us to repeat a function a certain amount of times, as long as it is contained within the loop. This is helpful because it allows us to draw a certain amount of "insert anything here" without having to repeat the code or copy and paste it. This is extremely useful and time saving, especially if you need to repeat code more than a couple times. I didn't help/get help from any of my study buddies this week, as I am sick, but this week's assignment was pretty easy compared to the rest, so I got along just fine.
