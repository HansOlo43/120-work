## My week in Creative Coding

This week in creative coding, I downloaded, installed, and took the first steps to learning how to use the programs for this class. It was challenging, but I got through it. When it came to choosing which programs I would use, after learning that Atom, GitHub Desktop, and [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) can all connect, it was an easy choice.

The steps I took to complete this assignment are as follows:

1. I came to the course website through the Moodle shell
2. I read through everything
  - Following directions as they came
3. Asked friends who have this class for help
4. Reffered to the instruction videos posted by Dr. Musick to double check everything

I had quite a few problems/issues during this weeks assignment:

- My PC wouldn't start for a few days after starting this assignment
- My PC wasn't working properly with the Programs, so I had to redo most everything on my laptop
- At the begining of this week, I had a hard time getting all of the programs to work together properly.

The first problem solved itself, I guess. I tried to fire up my PC when I could, and after a couple days of not working, it just started up just fine. The second problem was by far the most stressful. But the videos Dr. Musick posted helped speed through the process without having to stumpble around as much. The videos also solved my third problem, as downloading the programs exactly as in the videos had everything working well. I didn't post any of these problems to the class repo issue tracker, because they were mostly dealing with personal issues, such as my PC not wanting to start up; as well as the fact that I have a couple friends taking this class, so I just got their help when I needed.

There is nothing I really need to discuss more, and I didn't help anyone with the homework this past week, but I will make a habit of trying to do this at least once a week.

Here are some examples of inline code:
