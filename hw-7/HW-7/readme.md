# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--
--This is a Comment Block--

In the original code, we have a ellipse bouncing around a screen, like an old dvd screen saver. In lines 3-10, the new variables are defined. In 12-15 theres a normal setup function. Lines 19-39 are the draw function. Within that, on lines 21 and 22, the ball's motion is created. Lines 25-27 make sure that if the ball reaches either of the horizontal boundaries, it bounces off of them. The lines following (28-30), do the same thing, but for the vertical boundaries. Lines 32-34 color and draw the ellipse using the previously defined variables. And finally, in lines 36-39, is the code that changes the direction of the ball when you click on the screen near the ball.

## How did you alter the sketch?

<!--
I wanted to keep the whole "DVD Screensaver" feel (it was making me feel nostalgic), so all I really did was remove the stroke from the ellipse, add a couple more ellipses to the animation so it would resemble a circular "+" symbol, and then I added a random color fill to them so they would leave a randomly colored trail behind them. I really like how the subtle color changes look on the black background.
