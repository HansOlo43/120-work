This week, we learned about OOP, or Object Oriented Programming. This new way of writing code really makes the code much easier to read, if not a little harder to write...for now. I followed along with the bubble example, making changes where I wanted to. What I ended up with reminded me of something that you might find behind the DJ's setup at a rave. It's awesome that you can create a bunch of different objects from one "class." I did have a little difficulty understanding OOP at the beginning, but the blueprint/house metaphor really helped.
