## [hw-10 live]()

This week, we took what we learned last week, which was arrays, and combined them with this weeks topic: creating functions. I decided to re-do our first real "drawing." For the monster drawing, I made a new "draw______" function for each section of the monster, including his arms, body, and head. And for my array, I gave my ogre a phrase every ogre should know to flash across the screen: "Get outta my swamp!" I didn't really have any issues this week, as I was only really rewriting an old project, but it's awesome knowing that you can create your own functions to use anywhere in your code.
