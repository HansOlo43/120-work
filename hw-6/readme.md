## [hw-6 Animation](https://hansolo43.github.io/120-work/hw-6/)
This week in coding, we went a little bit deeper into animation. We learned how to use mathematical functions, and how to use a random number generator to do all sorts of fun stuff. My favorite was being able to fill any shape or the background with a constantly changing color. The whole math part is a little challenging for me, not so much as in coding, but just in general. Now that we are using more math, I should start to do my projects a little earlier than normal, as it takes me longer when I have to figure all of that out. Didn't help on the forums, but I helped my study group work through this, helping when they needed it, and getting help when I needed it.
