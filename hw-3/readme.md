# Homework Response
This week we started to use p5.js. I'm glad we are taking this slow to start, as working with this many programs side by side is a new experience for me. But the directions on the course website help tremendously. This week, I didn't really have any problems completing the homework or working with the new program. It's really cool to start to see what we will be doing in this course, even if its just a little bit of it. I didn't help anyone with an issue this week.
